# DSC UF - Diving Into Data
Make sure you download the dataset so you can follow along on Jupyter! </br></br>
Dataset was obtained here: https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016 </br></br>
To download the data scroll down to the data explorer and make sure you have  "NFL Play by Play 2009-2016 (v3).csv(233.68 MB)" selected. Click the download button to the right of the title to download the data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. Put the data in whatever file/directory you want, just make sure you know where it is so you can read the file in later in your code.
